00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Passionate and unique, driven collector and Academy associate

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.200
Ray Bandar has collected skulls for more than 60 years.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.000
His home is a natural history museum.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Throughout Ray's life, anytime has been a good time for collecting.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.200
The honeymoon trip occurred in 1954.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.000
It was a camping trip, 11 weeks of camping across the United States and Canada

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
in an old Ford convertible, a 1946 Ford. We ended up in Montreal and Quebec and New York and so on.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Coming back to the southwest, I saw the skeletal remains of a horse in Colorado. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I hopped a fence, got out, collected the skull, the pelvis, the limb bones, the vertebrae, packed it in the back. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And then from there on in, it was going out on weekends looking for road kills

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.200
and I made contact with the director of the zoo

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.000
and the vet, and so they'd contact me when animals had died

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
or they were going to euthanize an animal.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.200
So, I got a nice, large collection of exotic animals from around the world from the local zoos.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.000
Over the years, Ray has collected more than 7,000 skulls

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.200
including about 2,000 California sea lions

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.000
the largest museum collection of California sea lions in the world.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.200
Each specimen provides another valuable data point

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.200
for the scientists who come from around the globe to use his collection.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.000
Ray was employed by the California Academy of Sciences in the 1950s

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and started a training program for students.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.200
He then went on to teach high school biology, 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.000
anatomy and physiology for 32 years

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.200
but has continued to volunteer as an Academy Field Associate for more than half a century.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.000
It takes a special kind of person to cut off animal heads for the sake of science.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Ray is probably one of the most important resources we have here at the Academy, at least for this department

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
because not only is he retired and has the time to walk the beach and collect these animals

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
it's what he absolutely loves to do. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So, it's going to be difficult to find anybody that A, has the time

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and B, has this consuming passion, obsession, to be able to do this.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Because a lot of people won't be able to stomach it, a lot of people don't really understand

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.200
what goes on or why it's important.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.000
So, why do you collect the skull and not the rest of the body?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Well, if I'm walking up and down the beach for miles, and there's the carcass of a sea lion

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
there's no way I can haul the carcass back.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
It may take many hours to flesh out the meat and bring back the skeleton

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
which may take several trips.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And the skull is the easiest part to remove.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Now, the skull is like the pages in a book.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
It can tell you a lot about the lifestyle of an animal, 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
whether the animal walked upright

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
was a knuckle-dragger, if it walked on all fours, whether the animal was prey or predator.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Most of the collecting that I do, especially marine mammals, 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.200
is under special federal and state permits.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.000
And so, I've been under permit since the Marine Mammal Act of 1972.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.200
One look at this enormous collection and people often wonder why we need so many skulls.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.200
To use the analogy of a library, if you stop adding new books, 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.200
you stop adding new sources of information

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.000
and your body of knowledge stagnates over time.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
The same is true for a museum collection. And Ray continues adding with a passion.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Our collection would not be what it is without Rayâ€™s work.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
He has really almost single-handedly built our marine mammal collection.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Ray's work is an ongoing labor of love.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Walking in soft sand for miles on the beach isn't the easiest thing

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000
but I like the results.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:00.000
